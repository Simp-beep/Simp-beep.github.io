												<h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>

												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Myprofile.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

											<h3>My Educational History</h3>
											<p>There are many factors that have contributed to my desire to be a teacher. I have a true love and passion for working with youth and am encouraged to see them grow mentally. 
												I am passionate about having an impact on their lives, in not only an educational context but beyond the classroom. Relating to youth tends to come naturally to me, 
												and I feel that I have a strength in being able to relate and connect to them, which I am very grateful for. I also have a passion for subject areas regarding music and technology. 
												This was influential in my pursuit of a career that would incorporate these subject areas, as well as working with youth. This was strongly influential in determining my career as a high school teacher with a technology major.
												Also, I believe I possess certain qualities that would make me a great teacher, such as empathy, patience and a true passion for seeing student growth, both educationally and mentally.
											</p>
												
											<h3>Experiences</h3>
												<p>I have been fortunate enough to have different experiences with people in my life that have helped shape my decision in becoming a teacher. 
													This vast range of experiences is generated from my connections to church life, my family and my school community.</p>
												<p>Experience: Church</p>
												<p>My church community has provided me with opportunities to serve within its youth program, for both primary and high school-aged children. 
													This has seen me volunteer in the youth group, becoming a scripture teacher and also serving through a mothers playgroup. 
													This service has seen me experience all facets of teaching, including prepping, planning and teaching lessons, which has been a very valuable experience. 
													My ministries have helped me not only grow as an educator but has furthered my love and passion for educating the next generation.</p>

												<p>Experience: Family</p>
												<p>My family has played an influential role in my eagerness to become a teacher. My mother is a university lecturer, who has been motivational throughout my life in encouraging me to pursue teaching. 
													Her constant support and guidance has encouraged me to assess my interests and abilities, and help me understand that this career path would be an exceptional one for me. 
													Also, my cousin is a primary school teacher and has also helped me consider different aspects of being a teacher, which has been helpful in analysing both pros and cons to the profession.</p>
												
												<p>Experience: School</p>
												<p>My teachers have had a great influence on my life and have always pushed me to explore new areas of life, to be the best person I could be. I have learned essential skills through my school, 
													that provided me with the necessary qualities to be a teacher. These are perseverance, determination, courage and passion. Seeing the ways my teachers were dedicated to my education has made me want to incorporate this into the way I teach.  
													My school has made a lasting effect on my life and has provided me with an eagerness to do the same for others. Personally experiencing love from teachers has made me want to give this back to future students. 
													Within Educational Thought, I have been pushed to consider why I want to become a teacher. This is extremely important as it allows me to understand what approaches I want to take to my class, 
													and how I can use these to educate students to their maximal capacity.</p>
												
												<p>What teacher I want to be:</p>
												<p>Wellbeing: As previously mentioned, I had the greatest experiences with teachers who not only cared about my education but for my well-being too. 
													I value this teaching approach as it shows the care and love that teachers have for their students and allows them to feel safe and be able to grow within their environment. 
													Within my class, I want to emphasise the importance of fostering student-teacher relationships, as I feel that this allow children to feel safe to grow as individuals. 
													This can be achieved through having regular conversations, getting to know my students on a personal level, which will ultimately make them feel valued and appreciated. 
													I want to be a teacher that doesnt just teach lessons, but rather, teaches life skills aswell.</p>
												<p>Engaging: as my purpose is to educate my students from the curriculum, I want to be a teacher that can make the course content engaging, and find alternative ways to teach it. 
													For example, using acting activities, regular group work and making videos are all alternative ways that students can consolidate their knowledge, diverting from the traditional bookwork methods. </p>
												<p>Role model: I want to be a role model for my students, and instil confidence, respect and perseverance in them. I want to promote the importance of lifelong learning, 
													which I believe will be truly implemented when I present my manner to the class.</p>
												<p>Conclusion: Teaching is a big responsibility and I believe I am willing to take it on. I want to help my students to grow up in both their educational and personal lives, through respect and effort.</p>

												<h2>My Educational Philosophy</h2>

											<h3>Introduction</h3>
											<p>I will discuss in this segment my own educational philosophy that I believe should be integrated into my future classes. 
												I believe that teachers should be ever-learning (CITE), in order to better themselves, and their students. 
											</p>
												
											<h3>My Teaching Philosophy</h3>
												<p>I believe that my teaching philosophy is to allow my students to understand the importance of education, 
													and realise how this impacts society. As a result of this, I want them to hav an increased curisity for the world, 
													but also show respect in all matters of life. I want to build a safe and loving learning environment that allows students to grow. 
													Also, I want to be able to develop a personal relationship with my students, and  encourage them to expand their minds in all facets of life. 
													I wish to implement this through promoting this positive student-teacher relationship, as well as being invested in their individual lives.</p>
											
											<h3>Theorists that support my teaching ideologies</h3>
												<p>I believe that teachers should be ever-learning, in order to better themselves, and their students:</p>
												<p>- Before looking at whether education matters to society, we are going to look at Connells view on how society matters to education.</p>
												<p>- Connell empashises that ones social class and material items should not dictate ones education level, as it is what they choose to do with their sources that is central.</p> 
												<p>- Noddings believe the notion that education shoud help students grow and explore subjects of their own interest, to help them form a love for learning.</p>

											<h3>Topics that helped shape me</h3>
											<p>Equity, Dignity and Justice:</p>
												<p>- Studying this unit allowed me to further understand how education unfortunately is not equal for all. This inspired me, as an upcoming, future teacher, 
													to create my own classroom environment that promotes this sense of equity and justice, to allow equal opportunities for all of my students, 
													irrespective of race, gender and religion.</p>
												<p>- I want all the students in my class to have an equal and equitable education, allowing them to have equal accessibility to all resources. 
													There have been several writers that have not only inspired me, but allowed me to realise that I have the capability to create change within this educational landscape.</p>
												<p>- I was influenced by Christine Sleeter (2015), as her second dimension of achieving equity in skills was to develop relationships of reciprocity with students, families and communities.
													 I am a strong believer that an educators partnership with parents and guardians can create a safer learning environment that is able to enhance student learning</p>
												<p>- Also, I agree with Dodson who dictates that we, as a society, should reinforce the importance of increasing childrens employability skills in education as 
													well as increasing their knowledge of cultures within society (Dodson, 1993).</p>

											<p>Social Foundations of Schooling:</p>
												<p>- If we look through our history, we can see that we as a society are ever-changing, hence our education follows suit.</p>
												<p>- Ones social class plays a pivotal role in our education system.</p>
												<p>- Bourdieu and Passeron (1977) outlined the varying reasons for ones success and failure records at school.</p>
												<p>- They claimed that social class created patterns associated to school success and failure, and that by employing social class concepts, 
													they could infer an entirely distinct set of dynamics at work in Western cultures, linking "success" to a capital hierarchy.</p>
												<p>- Noddings (2003) believes the notion that education shou'd help students grow and explore subjects of their own interest, to help them foster a love for learning.</p>
												<p>- Our society and culture is shaped around certain areas of interests which can be explored in schooling, such as arts.</p>
