												<h2>About Me</h2>
												<p>Hi, my name's Hugh Simpson and I'm an up and coming TAS teacher with a specialty in Food.</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Hughprofile.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

											<h3>My teaching career so far</h3>
											<p>I am in my final year of a double degree in Bachelor Education (Secondary) and Bachelor Arts (Technology). I have completed three placements,
												all in varying learning envrionments where I was able to grow in my understanding and skills of all things teaching. I have also worked as a Student
												Learning Support Officer (SLSO) for the past two years which has also helped to grow me as a teacher, especially in working with students with
												disabilities. As I said previously, I am a future TAS teacher with a specialty in food. This includes timber, metal, coding, engineering, textiles and
												design and technology. Throughout my placements and studies have I been able to grow in my love and skill of all these areas, in particular timber,
												which is something that I had only done briefly at school but found a great passion in.
											</p>

											<h3>Personal interests</h3>
											<p>Alot of my personality and personal interests can be categorised into sport. Whether that is playing, talking about, studying, coaching,
												watching, I have a strong interest in sport. Have always enjoyed platying a wide range of sports from a young age, in particular football, rugby,
												swimming, running, cycling, cricket, basketball, netball and AFL just to name a few. Other than sport I also have a strong interest and passion in food, which
												goes well with my food technology teaching. From a young age my mother and grandmother taught me how to cook, and I instantly fell in love with it, wanting to
												always bake cookies, or help out with our meals at dinner. I still feel the same about cooking, always wanting to spend time in the kitchen, trialling new things, 
												learning new skills and creating delicious, tasty meals for myself and others to enjoy. This ultimately led me to think about a career in food, but the hours of a 
												chef didn't quite entice me, so I looked at other avenues and loved the sound of a food teacher.
